## **My Favourite Data Manipulation and Analysis Python Library is Pandas.it provides powerful, easy-to-use data structures and functions that make it a go-to tool for handling structured data like spreadsheets, databases, and time series**.

> ### *I use pandas for my tasks such as*:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
- **Data Wrangling**: Transforming data into a format suitable for analysis, reshaping datasets, and integrating multiple data sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: It simplifies the process of slicing, dicing, and visualizing data to extract insights.
- **Time Series Data**: Handling time-indexed data, applying rolling, expanding, or shifting windows for data analysis.
- **Data Aggregation**: Grouping data by columns and performing summary statistics or complex transformations.
